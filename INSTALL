NOTE: Baltrad Data Exchange System (BaltradDex) constitutes an integral part of
baltrad-node software package. As such, it provides full functionality only
if installed from baltrad-node software bundle. However it is possible to deploy
BaltradDex provided that the following two baltrad-node libraries are installed
in the system:

baltrad-db - Baltrad database management component
beast - Baltrad message management interface

Please refer to the documentation of the above packages for installation and
usage instructions.

Although the above configuration may work, the functionality it provides will
be limited and the system operation may be unstable. Therefore it should not
be used for operational work. It is strongly recommended to perform full
installation procedure using baltrad-node software package.

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java Development Kit (JDK) - version 1.6.0_20 or later.

Apache Tomcat - version 6.0.26 or later. BaltradDex is implemented as
Java Web Application. As such, it requires Apache Tomcat JSP and servlet
container to run. Once you have installed Apache Tomcat, remember to configure
administrative account to be used at the deployment stage. Your
tomcat-users.xml file should look like the following:

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users>
    <role rolename="tomcat"/>
    <role rolename="manager"/>
    <user password="tomcat" roles="tomcat" username="tomcat"/>
    <user password="tomcat" roles="role1" username="role1"/>
    <user password="s3cret" roles="manager,admin" username="manager"/>
</tomcat-users>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT: Starting from v0.7.5, BaltradDex supports only secure communication 
with SSL. Refer to SSL.CONFIG for detailed instructions on how to configure 
your Apache Tomcat installation to use secure communication.    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

Apache Ant build tool - version 1.7.1 or later. Build, deployment and other
tasks are executed and controlled by Apache Ant build tool. 

PostgreSQL database server - version 8.4 or later. BaltradDex uses PostgreSQL
database server to store its configuration and runtime parameters.

HDF Java - HDF5 libraries for Java, version 2.7 or later. HDF Java can be
either build from sources or installed as precompiled binaries. For
information and download go to:
http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf-java-html/

Prerequisites
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: BaltradDex references libraries available in baltrad-db and beast
components. Make sure these 2 components are installed on your system and
that suitable libraries are available before installing BaltradDex.

In order to be able to deploy and run the application, it is necessary to
create a dedicated database with suitable user. This is achieved by executing
build script task:

$       ant create-db

Installation / Deployment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build and deploy BaltradDex application on Tomcat server:

$	ant deploy

At this stage it may be necessary to modify appserver.properties file found in
BaltradDex/etc folder. Note that user's name and password for Tomcat user have
to match your setup in tomcat-users.xml.

To generate Javadoc source code 

$	ant javadocs

Running BaltradDex
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assuming that your Tomcat server is installed on local machine and listening 
on port 8084, in order to run the application, open a web browser and type 
the following in the address bar:

	http://localhost:8084/BaltradDex

Default user name is 'admin' with password 'baltrad'.
