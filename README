NOTE: Baltrad Data Exchange System (BaltradDex) constitutes an integral part of 
baltrad-node software package. As such, it provides full functionality only
if installed from baltrad-node software bundle. However it is possible to deploy 
BaltradDex provided that the following two baltrad-node libraries are installed
in the system:
 
baltrad-db - Baltrad database management component
beast - Baltrad message management interface

Please refer to the documentation of the above packages for installation and
usage instructions.

Although the above configuration may work, the functionality it provides will
be limited and the system operation may be unstable. Therefore it should not
be used for operational work. It is strongly recommended to perform full
installation procedure using baltrad-node software package.

The first step before installation is generating user manual, installation
instructions and source code documentation.  

NOTE: The following software packages are required to build documentation: 
- Java Development Kit (JDK) - version 1.6.0_20 or later.
- Apache Ant build tool - version 1.7.1 or later. 

To generate source code documentation and user manual:

$ cd BaltradDex
$ ant doc 

User manual and source code documentation will be stored in 
doc/build/doxygen/html folder and Javadoc source code documentation in
doc/build/javadoc
